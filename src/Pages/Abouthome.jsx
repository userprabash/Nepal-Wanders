            Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is bordered with
            China in the North and India in the east, west and south. The Modern
            Country was founded in the 19th Century by the Ancestors of the
            now-ousted King; Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. The country was
            Declared a Republic in 2005 after a popular revolt by the People
            against the then Head of the State, afore mentioned King. Today it
            is a Westminster multi-party parliamentary democracy, with the Head
            of the State as a Civilian President. <br />
            <br /> The country is a geographically, culturally, ethnically,
            religiously diverse state. Aryans, Mongols and Tibetans have long
            lived and shared the country mostly in peace, each arriving at
            various periods of the country’s history much in tandem with the
            movements and upheavals of Human Civilization’s own history.
            <br />
            <br /> In Medieval times, Nepal (especially the Kathmandu Valley,
            now Capital) had good diplomatic relations with Tibet, later annexed
            by China. Accounts of connubial relations, inter-border trade are
            rife. Our history’s first Encounter with the west is with “The
            East-India Company” before the Queen’s Reign. The Then Rulers of
            Nepal had trade relations with the Officers. Kathmandu was then
            considered a “Custom Point” for their produces bound for Tibet-
            China. Later the “ British Raj” under the Queen had even closer
            diplomatic ties with Nepal’s rulers. The episode of the Brave Nepali
            Gurkhas starts with these diplomatic relations. The Gurkhas were a
            regiment within the Queen’s Imperial army protecting the “Jewel in
            her crown”, .i.e. India. Recruited predominantly from the Mongol
            ethnicities, they served her through the World Wars. Their bravery
            in war was considered legendary. Famous German Generals are known to
            have extolled their valor in nemesis. In retribution for their
            services, Nepal’s rulers’ were conferred sovereignty as a
            “Protectorate State”. The British Army still has the regiment till
            date and Gurkhas are still recruited in the manner from the same
            ethnicities.

            Today Nepal is known in the World for her Nature. In the History of
            Nature itself, the Crashing of the Indian Plate with the Asian Plate
            is known to be the last Episodes of the Creation of Earth’s land as
            we know it today. The Himalayas was thus forged and the exposition
            of such gigantic proportions of Earth’s land is believed to have
            captured enough Carbon from the atmosphere cooling the Earth
            heralding the “coming of Cooler and more favorable climate”, in
            which Humans evolved.

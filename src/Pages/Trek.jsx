            The conquest of Annapurna I was remarkable in many ways. For a
            start, the French climbers spent weeks just trying to locate the
            mountain as it was still unexplored. It was the first eight-thousand
            to be climbed and even more remarkable was the fact that they did it
            on their first attempt. This was highly unusual as on most mountains
            of this size, many exploratory teams went up to study the possible
            routes up to the summit. Only after several expeditions had tried
            and failed would one eventually succeed. When Annapurna I was
            climbed, Nepal was still under Rana rule and the country was
            strictly closed to outsiders. The climb made Maurice Herzog, the
            expedition leader very famous, this being the first eight-thousander
            to be climbed. No expeditions had taken to the mountains from Nepal
            before this team and so sherpas had to be hired from Darjeeling from
            where many expeditions were launched via Tibet. Even before the team
            arrived in Nepal, they had given themselves two options: Climb
            Dhaulagiri or Annapurna. Finding the former too difficult to climb,
            they turned their attention to the latter.
